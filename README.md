## General Rules:
There must be 2 programs.
  - Main Program: BATCHPRG.
  - Sub Program: BATCHIDX.
</br>

There must be 3 files:
  - Input File: Z95752.QSAM.INP.
  - Output File: Z95752.QSAM.OUTP.
  - Data File: Z95752.VSAM.AA (I can not import the VSAM file here so I imported the QSAM file).
</br> </br>
The main program should read the input file and report the operations made in the sub program to the output file.
The sub program should only handle VSAM file.
</br>

There are 4 mandatory statement: SET - STRING - EVALUATE - INSPECT
  - SET statement is used to assign values to variables or to modify the contents of a variable. 
  - STRING statement is used to concatenate or combine multiple character strings into a single string. 
  - EVALUATE statement is used to perform multiple conditional tests and execute corresponding actions based on the evaluated conditions.
  - INSPECT statement is used to manipulate and transform data within a data item based on specified patterns or rules. It allows you to search, replace, or count occurrences of characters or groups of characters within a string.
